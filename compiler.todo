1. **File Parsing Module:**
   - [ ] Implement a file watcher to detect changes in `.hubble` files.
   - [ ] Create a function to read and extract the content of `.hubble` files.
   - [ ] Develop a mechanism to generate routing from the `pages` folder tree.

2. **Code Transformation:**
   - [ ] Define a clear structure for the generated JavaScript code for Hubble components.
   - [ ] Resolve imported component paths relative to the current file's location.
   - [ ] Load imported components and include their content in the compilation process.
   - [ ] Handle circular dependencies between components to prevent infinite loops or crashes.

3. **Exporting:**
   - [ ] Write the transformed JavaScript code into `.js` files using a consistent naming convention.
   - [ ] Implement a method to organize the exported JavaScript files within the project folder structure.
   - [ ] Provide options for minification and optimization during the export process.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - [ ] Set up robust error handling mechanisms to catch syntax errors and other issues in Hubble files.
   - [ ] Create detailed error messages with contextual information to aid developers in debugging.
   - [ ] Include logging functionality to track errors and warnings during the compilation process.

5. **Testing:**
   - [ ] Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify the accuracy of the code transformation.
   - [ ] Design test cases to cover all possible scenarios, including different Hubble directives and edge cases.
   - [ ] Use mock data and scenarios to simulate real-world usage and identify potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Documentation:**
   - [ ] Create thorough documentation for the compiler module, covering installation, configuration, and usage instructions.
   - [ ] Provide clear examples of Hubble syntax and demonstrate how it translates into JavaScript placeholders.
   - [ ] Include best practices, tips, and common pitfalls to help developers effectively utilize the compiler.

7. **Integration:**
   - [ ] Integrate the compiler seamlessly with other modules within the Hubble framework.
   - [ ] Ensure compatibility and interoperability with existing components and libraries.
   - [ ] Conduct thorough integration testing to validate the functionality and performance of the compiler within the framework ecosystem.
