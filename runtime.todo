1. **Setup and Initialization:**
   - [ ] Initialize the runtime module to handle Hubble components and directives.
   - [ ] Implement a mechanism to load and register Hubble components dynamically.
   - [ ] Set up event listeners to detect changes in the DOM for reactive updates.

2. **Component Lifecycle:**
   - [ ] Define lifecycle hooks for Hubble components (e.g., created, mounted, updated, destroyed).
   - [ ] Execute lifecycle hooks at appropriate stages during component initialization, updates, and removal.

3. **Directive Handling:**
   - [ ] Define handlers for core Hubble directives (e.g., x-data, x-bind, x-on, x-text, x-if, x-else, x-for, x-model, x-props).
   - [ ] Implement logic to interpret and execute each directive's behavior in response to DOM events or changes.

4. **Data Binding:**
   - [ ] Implement two-way data binding for x-model directive to synchronize data between DOM elements and component data.
   - [ ] Ensure data reactivity by updating DOM elements when component data changes and vice versa.

5. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - [ ] Implement logic to conditionally render elements based on x-if and x-else directives.
   - [ ] Handle dynamic changes in conditional rendering based on data updates.

6. **List Rendering:**
   - [ ] Implement logic to render lists of elements based on x-for directive.
   - [ ] Handle dynamic updates to lists and efficient re-rendering of list items.

7. **Event Handling:**
   - [ ] Set up event listeners for x-on directives to handle DOM events such as clicks, keys press, etc.
   - [ ] Define and execute event handlers specified in x-on directives.

8. **Props Handling:**
   - [ ] Implement logic to pass props from parent components to child components using x-props directive.
   - [ ] Ensure proper updating of props and re-rendering of child components when props change.

9. **Router Integration:**
   - [ ] Integrate hash-based router to manage client-side navigation.
   - [ ] Implement logic to map routes to corresponding Hubble components and render them dynamically.

10. **Error Handling:**
    - [ ] Implement error handling mechanisms to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.
    - [ ] Provide informative error messages and logging to aid in debugging.

11. **Testing:**
    - [ ] Develop unit tests for each directive and core functionality of the runtime module.
    - [ ] Create integration tests to validate the interaction between different directives and components.
    - [ ] Ensure comprehensive test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios.

12. **Documentation:**
    - [ ] Document the usage of the runtime module, including available directives and lifecycle hooks.
    - [ ] Provide examples and tutorials demonstrating how to use Hubble directives and components effectively.
    - [ ] Include troubleshooting tips and common pitfalls when working with the runtime module.

13. **Integration:**
    - [ ] Integrate the runtime module with other parts of the Hubble framework, such as the compiler and router.
    - [ ] Test the integration thoroughly to ensure seamless communication and interoperability between modules.
